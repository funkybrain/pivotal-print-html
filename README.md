## Print like a boss!

This love child born of the first Babbel hackaton will allow you to print user stories from Pivotal Tracker.

TODO:
- improve form layout and formatting
- save input fields to local storage
- enable more advanced filtering (e.g. label AND pivotal pane)
- refactor horrible code (lots of not DRY in there)
- enable 1 vs 4 story per page (for grooming vs printing)
